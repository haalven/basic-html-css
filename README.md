### what is this?

- for users familiar with HTML
- internal CSS with clean, consistent layout

### why HTML & CSS?

- responsive: works on desktop and mobile
- automatic dark mode
- modern semantic HTML structure
- very good performance, works on older hardware
- the template size is &lt;&nbsp;6&nbsp;㎅
- universally accessible: every device has a browser
- future-proof through continuous browser development
- compatible with any text editor
- faster authoring with [Zen coding](https://emmet.io/)
- no compatibility issues
- no proprietary code
- HTML and CSS are highly customizable
- browsers can translate documents on the fly
- optional scripting via JavaScript / TypeScript
- easy assistance from chatbots and AI tools
- system-level search support for document content
- dozens of tools for converting HTML to PDF or other formats
- simple publishing just through file upload

### what it is _not:_

- cannot embed raster images or custom fonts in a single file
- not well-suited for high-quality printing (CSS limitations)
- semantic writing approach, not WYSIWYG
- [Markdown](https://markdownguide.offshoot.io/basic-syntax/) and [similar formats](https://mystmd.org/sandbox) are simpler to learn
  - but: MD is converted to HTML for rendering
  - and: common elements are missing, requiring HTML anyway
- [Typst](https://typst.app/) is much better than everything
  - but: you have to learn it

## semantic structure

- html
  - head
    - title
  - body
    - header
      - h1
      - nav
    - main
      - article
        - h2
    - footer
