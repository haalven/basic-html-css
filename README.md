# basic modern HTML & CSS template
a very modern, very basic and very small and fast html-css boilerplate file for (scientific) text documents

[raw_textfile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haalven/basic-html-css-de/refs/heads/main/html_template.html)

## what is this?

- this is for people familiar with HTML
- it is a template for HTML text documents
- the internal CSS does a clean layout for common elements
- works on computers and mobile screens
- switches automatically to dark style in night mode
- the semantic structure of the HTML template is modern
- very performative, works easily on older hardware
- because every device has a browser, this works everywhere
- browser development and optimization is ongoing, this is future-proof
- you can use any editor software you want
- writing HTML tags can be done faster by [Zen coding](https://emmet.io/)
- no compatibility issues
- no proprietary code involved
- HTML and CSS are very powerful languages if you need something special
- scripting is available via Javascript / Typescript
- chatbots can easily help you with everything
- operating systems can easily search the document’s content
- there are dozens of tools to convert HTML to PDF or to whatever…
- publishing the document is just an upload

## what it is NOT:

- this is not a good solution for printing pages (CSS has limitations here)
- this is semantic writing and not WYSIWIG
  - but: you can preview the document in your browser
- Markdown (and similar languages) are much more simplistic and easier to learn
  - but: to render Markdown it is converted to HTML anyway
  - and: some common elements are missing, so you end up writing HTML anyway
- [Typst](https://typst.app/) is much better than everything
  - but: you have to learn it
