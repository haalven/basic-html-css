### what it is _not:_

- cannot embed raster images or custom fonts in a single file
- not well-suited for high-quality printing (CSS limitations)
- semantic writing approach, not WYSIWYG
- Markdown and similar formats are simpler to learn
  - but: Markdown is converted to HTML for rendering
  - and: common elements are missing, requiring HTML anyway
- [Typst](https://typst.app/) is much better than everything
  - but: you have to learn it
